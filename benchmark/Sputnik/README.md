## This folder contains the benchmarking code using the Sputnik library

The main library is benchmark.py, which will profile the [matrices](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/sgk) provided by [Sputnik repo](https://github.com/google-research/sputnik)

I used the wrapper for sputnik shown in the previous code in [Kevin's repo](https://github.com/kckevinchen/SparseBenchmark)

And here is the corresponding [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Wzzp05nceeqEUb23i0kf9h_XR5xN2ewe?usp=sharing) for all the plots, and the csv file. To get started, call the `run_jupyter.sh`, and copy the url to colab.
